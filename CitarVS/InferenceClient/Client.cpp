A popular algorithm for indexing is the tdf mea-sure, which extracts keywords that appear frequently in a document, but that don't appear frequently in the remainder of the corpus. The term keyword extraction is used in the context of text mining, for example 15. A comparable research topic is called automatic term recognition in the context of computational linguistics and automatic indexing or automatic keyword extraction in information retrieval research."));
